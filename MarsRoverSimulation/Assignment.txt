SPECIFICATION

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. The navigation team 

needs a utility for them to simulate rover movements so they can develop a navigation plan.

A rover's position is represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates and a letter

representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to

simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom

left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are:

· 'L' – Make the rover spin 90 degrees left without moving from its current spot

· 'R' - Make the rover spin 90 degrees right without moving from its current spot

· 'M'. Move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.
